# SPA-Assignments
Assignments for the course Stochastic Processes & Its Applications. All simulations were done using Python.

## Assignment 1
1) Simulating a Bernoulli Process by tossing of a coin multiple times.
2) Simulating a Poisson process, observing the density of arrivals and the nth inter-arrival times of the process.

## Assignment 2
1) Simulating a a finite state discrete time Markov chain, observing the stationary and limiting distributions.
2) Simulating a 1-D Random Walk & comparing the actual and simulated probabilities.
